O22,DATA-01,Data,gemini-2.5-pro,1.0,0.0,0.0,DATA-01,"The model explicitly states that the idea is not new and is the current industry standard, thus PAAS is 1.0. The idea is a verbatim match for existing data warehouses, so CNS is 0.0."
O23,CONTROL,Control,gemini-2.5-pro,0.7,0.2,0.24000000000000005,,"The model acknowledges that 'truly new' rarely means inventing something from a complete vacuum, signaling non-novelty. The ideas presented are parametric tweaks, focusing on niche communities or different core interactions, rather than introducing a new irreducible mechanism."
