The idea is a parametric tweak of existing shared fulfillment models, focusing on a specific niche (small e-commerce brands)."
O02,LOG-02,Logistics,groq-kimi-k2,0.7,0.0,0.30000000000000004,LOG-02,"The model acknowledges the existence of competitors like DoorDash Drive and Uber Direct, signaling non-novelty. The core idea is on-demand last-mile delivery, which already exists, so CNS is 0.0."
O03,FIN-01,Fintech,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.4,0.0,FIN-01,"The model explicitly names existing BNPL companies and states that the market is saturated. The suggestions are recombinatorial, such as vertical SaaS + embedded BNPL."
O04,FIN-02,Fintech,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.4,0.0,FIN-02,"The model explicitly names existing neobanks and acknowledges the lack of novelty in a mobile-first bank. The ideas presented are recombinations of existing fintech solutions, such as embedded investing and AI co-pilots, within a neobank context."
O05,FIN-03,Fintech,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.4,0.0,FIN-03,"The model explicitly names existing solutions like Plaid and Mint, indicating awareness of prior art. The suggested wedges are recombinations of existing features like budgeting, tax withholding, and bill negotiation."
O06,HLT-01,Health,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.0,0.0,HLT-01,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of telemedicine and names competitors like Amwell and MDLive.

O12,DEV-01,DevTools,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.2,0.0,DEV-01,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of GitHub Copilot and other similar tools. The idea is a parametric tweak of existing AI coding assistants, focusing on specific verticals and compliance."
O13,DEV-02,DevTools,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.0,0.0,DEV-02,"The model explicitly names existing APM/observability tools and AIOps platforms, acknowledging the lack of novelty. The idea is a standard application of ML to observability data, which is already done by existing tools."
O14,DEV-03,DevTools,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.0,0.0,DEV-01,The model explicitly acknowledges existing solutions like Pulumi AI and Terraform Generate. The idea is a cosmetic rephrasing of existing AI coding assistants.
O15,AI-01,AI-Tooling,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.0,0.0,AI-01,"The model explicitly names existing vector databases, indicating awareness of prior art. The idea itself is a verbatim instance of AI-01 (LLM Infrastructure / Vector Database)."
O16,AI-01,AI-Tooling,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.2,0.0,AI-01,"The model explicitly names existing solutions like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and MemGPT. The idea is a parametric tweak on existing LLM infrastructure, focusing on a specific vertical and adding features like federated learning."
O17,AI-02,AI-Tooling,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.0,0.0,AI-02,"The model explicitly names existing model serving platforms like Hugging Face Inference API, Together, Replicate, Fireworks, Modal, Anyscale, Baseten, Perplexity’s pplx-api, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, Azure AI, etc. The idea is a commodity, and the model suggests focusing on a niche or adding value-added services."
O18,NOCODE-01,No-Code,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.0,0.0,NOCODE-01,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of many drag-and-drop website builders. The response does not introduce any new conceptual primitives, instead focusing on niche markets and distribution strategies within the existing framework of no-code app builders."
O19,NOCODE-02,No-Code,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.0,0.0,NOCODE-02,"The model explicitly names existing solutions like Zapier and Make, indicating awareness of prior art. The core idea of connecting apps without code is already present in existing automation platforms, so there is no conceptual novelty."

O23,CONTROL,Control,groq-kimi-k2,0.7,0.4,0.18000000000000002,,"The model acknowledges the difficulty of creating something truly new in social media, but still frames the ideas as novel explorations of 'unmapped deltas'. The ideas are recombinatorial, such as an 'anti-platform' or a platform that destroys itself."
O24,CONTROL,Control,groq-kimi-k2,0.7,0.0,0.30000000000000004,,"The model acknowledges the difficulty of competing with Google and suggests focusing on a niche market. However, it still frames the idea as potentially achievable, which implies some degree of novelty despite the existing challenges and competition."
O25,CONTROL,Control,groq-kimi-k2,0.7,0.4,0.18000000000000002,,"The model acknowledges that competing directly with Amazon on price and speed is not viable, suggesting the idea isn't entirely novel. The idea is a recombination of existing marketplace strategies (curation, community focus) rather than a completely new mechanism."
O26,STRESS,Stress-Test,groq-kimi-k2,1.0,0.4,0.0,FIN-01,"The model explicitly states that BNPL already exists and names several companies. The suggestions are recombinatorial, such as geographic or vertical-specific BNPL."
