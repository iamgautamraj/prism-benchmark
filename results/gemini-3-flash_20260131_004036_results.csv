O04,FIN-02,Fintech,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,FIN-02,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of neobanks like Chime and Revolut, thus PAAS is 1.0. The ideas presented are recombinations of existing features (gamification, social features, ethical banking, AI assistance, alternative credit scoring) within the neobank context, so CNS is 0.4. The best RPAC match is FIN-02 (Neobanks)."
O05,FIN-03,Fintech,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,FIN-03,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of PFM apps and names competitors. The suggestions are recombinatorial, such as adding AI/LLM or focusing on a niche."
O06,HLT-01,Health,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.2,0.0,HLT-01,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of telemedicine platforms like Teladoc and Amwell.

The idea of a specialized workspace for a specific industry is a recombinatorial approach (existing workspace + vertical focus)."
O12,DEV-01,DevTools,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,DEV-01,"The model acknowledges the existence of AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. The suggestions are recombinatorial, such as focusing on niche languages or building an agent that automates the entire development process."
O13,DEV-02,DevTools,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.0,0.0,DEV-02,"The model explicitly names existing solutions like Datadog and New Relic, acknowledging the lack of novelty. The core idea of using ML to predict server outages is already present in existing APM solutions, making the conceptual novelty zero."
O14,DEV-03,DevTools,gemini-3-flash,0.7,0.2,0.24000000000000005,DEV-01,"The model acknowledges the existence of similar tools like Pulumi Insights and Amazon Q, signaling non-novelty. The core idea is a parametric tweak of existing IaC tools, using natural language as the interface."
O15,AI-01,AI-Tooling,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.2,0.0,AI-01,"The model explicitly names existing vector databases like Pinecone and Weaviate. The suggestions for differentiation are parametric tweaks like scale, cost, modality, or edge deployment."
O16,AI-01,AI-Tooling,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,AI-01,The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of RAG frameworks and vector databases. The ideas presented are recombinations of existing concepts like time-series databases and knowledge graphs with memory frameworks.
O17,AI-02,AI-Tooling,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.0,0.0,AI-02,"The model explicitly names existing players in the LLM hosting space, indicating awareness of prior art. The suggestions for differentiation are all parametric tweaks or recombinations of existing services."
O18,NOCODE-01,No-Code,gemini-3-flash,0.7,0.2,0.24000000000000005,NOCODE-01,"The model acknowledges the crowded market and suggests a vertical strategy, which signals non-novelty. The core idea is a parametric tweak (niche focus) on existing no-code app builders."
O19,NOCODE-02,No-Code,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,NOCODE-02,The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of iPaaS solutions like Zapier and Make. The idea of using AI to improve the integration process is a recombination of existing concepts.
O20,SEC-01,Security,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.2,0.0,SEC-01,"The model explicitly names existing players like CrowdStrike and SentinelOne, acknowledging the lack of novelty. The core idea is still endpoint protection, with parametric tweaks like focusing on IoT or SMBs."
O21,SEC-02,Security,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.0,0.0,SEC-02,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of passwordless authentication solutions from major players like Okta and Microsoft. The suggestions for differentiation are all parametric tweaks (vertical focus, legacy bridge, developer experience, consolidation) on existing IAM/Identity solutions."
O22,DATA-01,Data,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,DATA-01,"The model explicitly acknowledges that separating storage and compute is already the industry standard. The ideas presented are recombinations of existing data warehouse solutions with specific focuses like open formats, serverless, real-time, or AI integration."
O23,CONTROL,Control,gemini-3-flash,0.7,0.2,0.24000000000000005,,"The model acknowledges that creating something 'truly new' is difficult and that existing platforms have feature parity, signaling non-novelty. However, the ideas presented are mostly parametric tweaks or recombinations of existing social media concepts (e.g., constraint-based platforms, smaller communities, AI-native features)."
O24,CONTROL,Control,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,,"The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of other search engines like DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, and Kagi Search. The ideas presented are recombinations of existing approaches (niche search, privacy-first, ad-free, AI-first)."

However, the core ideas are parametric tweaks to existing e-commerce models, focusing on curation, community, values, specialization, authenticity, and discovery."
O26,STRESS,Stress-Test,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.4,0.0,FIN-01,The model explicitly acknowledges the existence of BNPL and names existing companies. The suggestion to focus on niche BNPL is a recombination of BNPL with specific verticals.
O27,STRESS,Stress-Test,gemini-3-flash,1.0,0.0,0.0,FIN-02,The model explicitly states that the idea is not new and names existing neobanks. The idea is a verbatim match for the neobank archetype.
